    Sets up the introduction of the fake esports player: "Flambo". It also adds a line
    divider between the heading and the first paragraph. It also sets the pages width to 65%
    Important, do not shift the center class up as this will make the divider not stretch out
    as long and in turn lose the proper asthetic it currently has.

    -->
    <h2>Career Overview</h2>
    <p>Flambo's esports career began in 2019 on the fps battle royale game Apex Legends. During this year, he would sign a contract with the esports
      organization NRG as their In-Game-Leader. However, Flambo would struggle with finding a balance between playing such an aggresive character such
      as Wraith, and also leading his team to victory. Towards the end of 2019, he would switch to Wattson and Bloodhound where he found more success.
      With these characters, Flambo would go on to win 2 North American tourneys. Flambo would then make the decision during the height of the pandemic
      in 2020 to switch to Valorant. He would be signed by the esports organization 100 Thieves as their In-Game-Leader. Flambo currently plays a myriad
      of agents such as Phoenix, Viper, and Sage. He has won three tourneys as of 2022.
